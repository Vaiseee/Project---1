 # A Circuit Technique for Leakage Power Reduction in CMOS VLSI Circuits

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on reducing leakage power in CMOS VLSI circuits using a novel circuit technique. The aim is to enhance power efficiency in integrated circuits.

## 🔍 Existing Method
The existing technique relies on [brief explanation, e.g., sleep transistors, dual threshold voltage, etc.]. However, it has some limitations in terms of [e.g., delay, area, power overhead].

## 💡 Proposed Method
We propose an improved method that uses [brief explanation]. This approach helps in [benefits like reduced leakage, lower power consumption, etc.].

## 📈 Result
The simulation and analysis show a significant reduction in leakage power compared to the existing method. The results are validated using tools like [e.g., Microwind, TANNER EDA, etc.].
